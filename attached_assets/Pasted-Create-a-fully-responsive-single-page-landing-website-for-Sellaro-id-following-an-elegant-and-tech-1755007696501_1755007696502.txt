Technical Notes:

Use pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no heavy frameworks).

Use CSS variables for theme colors so dark/light mode works by toggling classes.

Include SEO meta tags and Open Graph tags for better sharing.

Translate all content to English for EN toggle.

Organize CSS and JS in separate files for maintainability.

Output the complete project with all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files so it can be run instantly on Replit without extra setup.
